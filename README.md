# MLP Besed Flexible Framework Adsorption Simulation with Hybrid MD/GCMC

This repository contains code for performing adsorption simulations in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) using both MLP-based rigid GCMC and hybrid MD/GCMC simulations that incorporate framework flexibility. The simulations leverage a machine-learned potential (MLP), specifically a equivariant interatomic potentials (NeqIP)

The code is actively under development. We warmly welcome contributions from the community â€” whether it's fixing issues, improving documentation, or extending functionality.

## Hybrid MD/GCMC Workflow

The overall workflow of the simulation algorithm is illustrated in the following scheme, summarizing the key steps of the MLP-based GCMC and hybrid MD/GCMC approach.

## Installaitoin

Before running the simulation code, ensure the following Python packages are installed:

- `nequip`
- `pair_nequip`
- `ase`
- `molmod`
- `CoolProp`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy torch ase molmod CoolProp
```
