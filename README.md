# Overview
MD/GCMC
This repository contains code for performing adsorption simulations in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) using both MLP-based rigid GCMC and hybrid MD/GCMC simulations that incorporate framework flexibility. The simulations leverage a machine-learned potential (MLP), specifically a neural network potential (NNP), trained on DFT-level data for accurate representation of complex guest–MOF interactions, including those at open metal sites (OMS).

The code is actively under development. We warmly welcome contributions from the community — whether it's fixing issues, improving documentation, or extending functionality.
